# CalculatorApp

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.0.4.

## Prerequisites:

- Node.js - `node --version`
- Angular CLI - `npm install -g @angular/cli`

## Star the project:

1. Clone the project
2. Install the dependencies in the terminal `npm install`
3. Start the server

```bash
ng serve --live-reload=true --poll=2000
```

In some editors Angular doesn't notice when a file is changes.

To ensure the application automatically reloads:

`--live-reload=true` → Makes sure Angular tries to reload the page when files change.`

`--poll=2000` → Tells Angular to check for changes every 2000 ms (2 seconds) instead of waiting for the system to tell it.

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.
